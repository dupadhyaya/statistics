#The first example is for equal variances  Let A1 and A2 denote two random samples:
  
A1 = c(27.5,21.0,19.0,23.6,17.0,17.9,16.9,20.1,21.9,22.6,23.1,19.6,19.0,21.7,21.4)
A2 = c(27.5,21.0,19.0,23.6,17.0,17.9,16.9,20.1,21.9,22.6,23.1,19.6,19.0,21.7,21.4)

#The second example is for unequal variances
B1 = c(17.2,20.9,22.6,18.1,21.7,21.4,23.5,24.2,14.7,21.8)
B2 = c(21.5,22.8,21.0,23.0,21.6,23.6,22.5,20.7,23.4,21.8,20.7,21.7,21.5,22.5,23.6,21.5,22.5,23.5,21.5,21.8)

#The third example is for unequal variances. The larger sample has the larger variance:
  
C1 = c(19.8,20.4,19.6,17.8,18.5,18.9,18.3,18.9,19.5,22.0)
C2 = c(28.2,26.6,20.1,23.3,25.2,22.1,17.7,27.6,20.6,13.7,23.2,17.5,20.6,18.0,23.9,21.6,24.3,20.4,24.0,13.2)
