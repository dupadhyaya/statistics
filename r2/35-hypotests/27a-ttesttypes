Types of T - Test

There are three main types of t-test:

An Independent Samples t-test compares the means for two groups. It can be <, = , >


A Paired sample t-test compares means from the same group at different times (say, one year apart).


A One sample t-test tests the mean of a single group against a known mean

#---------------------------
One of the most common tests in statistics is the t-test, used to
determine whether the means of two groups are equal to each other. 

The assumption for the test is that both groups are sampled from normal distributions with equal variances. 

The null hypothesis is that the two means are equal, and 
the alternative is that they are not. 

It is known that under the null hypothesis, we can calculate a t-statistic that will follow a t-distribution with n1 + n2 - 2 degrees of freedom. 

There is also a widely used modification of the t-test, known as Welch's t-test that adjusts the number of degrees of freedom when the variances are thought not to be equal to each other.

# independent 2-group t-test
t.test(y~x) # where y is numeric and x is a binary factor

# independent 2-group t-test
t.test(y1,y2) # where y1 and y2 are numeric

# paired t-test
t.test(y1,y2,paired=TRUE) # where y1 & y2 are numeric

# one sample t-test
t.test(y,mu=3) # Ho: mu=3

You can use the var.equal = TRUE option to specify equal variances and a pooled variance estimate.

You can use the alternative="less" or alternative="greater" option to specify a one tailed test.

t.test(x, y = NULL,
       alternative = c("two.sided", "less", "greater"),
       mu = 0, paired = FALSE, var.equal = FALSE,
       conf.level = 0.95, ...)

#--------
The independent-samples test can take one of three forms, depending on the structure of your data and the equality of their variances. 
The general form of the test is t.test(y1, y2, paired=FALSE). 
By default, R assumes that the variances of y1 and y2 are unequal, thus defaulting to Welch’s test. 
To toggle this, we use the flag var.equal=TRUE.

#-----
Independent word : paired=FALSE
Sample taken again from same populatoin : var.equal = TRUE
If taken from different population : var.equal=FALSE

#
In statistics, we can define the corresponding null hypothesis (H0) as follow:

H0:m=0
H0:m≤0
H0:m≥0

The corresponding alternative hypotheses (Ha) are as follow:

Ha:m≠0 (different)
Ha:m>0 (greater)
Ha:m<0 (less)

#------
Student's t-test assumes that the two populations have normal distributions and with equal variances. Welch's t-test is designed for unequal variances, but the assumption of normality is maintained


#------
Two unpaired t tests 

When you choose to compare the means of two nonpaired groups with a t test, you have two choices:

Use the standard unpaired t test. It assumes that both groups of data are sampled from Gaussian populations with the same standard deviation.

Use the unequal variance t test, also called the Welch t test. It assues that both groups of data are sampled from Gaussian populations, but does not assume those two populations have the same standard deviation.
