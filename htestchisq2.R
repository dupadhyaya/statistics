#Ha: Gender and voting preferences are not independent.

#Formulate an analysis plan. For this analysis, the significance level is 0.05.

#Analyze sample data. Applying the chi-square test for independence to sample data, 
#we compute the degrees of freedom, the expected frequency counts, and the chi-square test statistic. 
#Based on the chi-square statistic and the degrees of freedom, we determine the P-value.
